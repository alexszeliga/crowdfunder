# CROWDFUNDER MVP DESCRIBED BY A ROBOT

Crowdfunder has two main routes: shop and post.

Crowdfunder’s MVP search posts, filters posts, create post, create user, log in, log out, like post, follow post, comment post

- Post has one name
- Post has one creator
- Post has one description
- Post has one website
- Post has many blogs
- Post has many pictures
- Post has many comments
- Post has many likes
- Post has many follows

- User has one password
- User has one email address
- User has one name

- User has many posts
- User has many comments

## user interaction meta

- Comment has one user
- Comment has one post

- Follow has one user
- Follow has one post

- Like has one user
- Like has one post

* Blogs have one title
* Blogs have one summary
* Blogs have one body

Shop route shows grid of ‘featured’ items (most likes and follows in the last few days)

Clicking on item opens modal

Modal shows post content and CTA to follow / like

Following a post pops modal to provide email address or use one associated with account

For MVP, pledging support is non-monetary; the user who created a post will see special post info, including these two lists separately.

Post route allows user to create a new campaign. This will be feature poor for now with a push to make much more robust CMS for users in the next release.

The user will be able to create an unlimited number of blogs and provide URLs for as many pics as they’d like; they will be displayed in a carouselle on the post-single display.
